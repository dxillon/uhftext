We never disclose client data to third parties without explicit consent. Every member of our team is bound by confidentiality agreements, ensuring your ideas and information remain protected."

We maintain closed sets when necessary, restrict behind-the-scenes photography without permission, and enforce clear privacy protocols. Any personal or professional information gathered during filming is handled with discretion and used solely for project-related purposes."

We never share your content publicly or with third parties unless you explicitly authorize us to do so."

      title: "Third-Party Service Providers",
      content: "At times, to support our production process and ensure seamless delivery, we may collaborate with trusted third-party service providers. These may include, but are not limited to, cloud storage providers, post-production studios, freelance specialists, legal advisors, or content distribution platforms. We ensure that all third parties we work with are contractually bound to maintain strict confidentiality and adhere to the same security and privacy standards that we uphold internally. Before sharing any project data or footage, we vet each provider's security policies, enforce non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) where necessary, and limit access only to the data essential for the service being performed. Under no circumstances will we sell, share, or disclose client information or content for marketing or unauthorized purposes."

      icon: ShieldCheck,
      title: "Rights of the Client",
      content: "We believe in empowering our clients with full control over their data and content. Clients have the right to request access to any personal data or production-related materials we hold about them. This includes viewing stored content, understanding how it is used, and requesting corrections if any information is inaccurate. Furthermore, clients may request the secure deletion of their data or footage upon project completion, provided that it does not conflict with any legal retention requirements or contractual obligations. To exercise these rights, clients can simply reach out to us via the contact information provided on our website. We are committed to responding to all legitimate requests within a reasonable timeframe and ensuring complete transparency throughout the process."
